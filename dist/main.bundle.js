Each Stat Fragment has an associated stat that it will improve, as well as a multiplier on its effectiveness known as power. When initially placed, a Stat Fragment will have no effect. In order for the fragment to gain stat boosts, it must be charged. The other kind of fragments are known as Booster Fragments, which take up 5 tiles of the grid.

Note that it is no more effective to charge a fragment many times with few threads than to charge few times with many threads, so there is no need to distribute charging jobs across multiple scripts. As a Stat Fragment's charge level is increased, its bonuses will increase, but there will be diminishing returns.

This requires $150b of your own money, but this $150b will get put into your Corporation's funds. Your Corporation can have many different divisions, each in a different Industry. There are many different types of Industries, each with different properties. To create your first division, click the 'Expand into new Industry' button at the top of the management UI. The Agriculture and Software industries are recommended for your first division.<br><br>The first thing you'll need to do is hire some employees. Employees can be assigned to five different positions. Each position has a different effect on various aspects of your Corporation. It is recommended to have at least one employee at each position.<br><br>Each industry uses some combination of Materials in order to produce other Materials and/or create Products. Specific information about this is displayed in each of your divisions' UI.<br><br>Products are special, industry-specific objects. They are different than Materials because you must manually choose to develop them, and you can choose to develop any number of Products. Developing a Product takes time, but a Product typically generates significantly more revenue than any Material. Not all industries allow you to create Products. To create a Product, look for a button in the top-left panel of the division UI (e.g. For the Software Industry, the button says 'Develop Software').<br><br>To get your supply chain system started, purchase the Materials that your industry needs to produce other Materials/Products. This can be done by clicking the 'Buy' button next to the corresponding Material(s). After you have the required Materials, you will immediately start production. The amount of Materials/Products you produce is based on a variety of factors, one of which is your employees and their productivity.<br><br>Once you start producing Materials/Products, you can sell them in order to start earning revenue. This can be done by clicking the 'Sell' button next to the corresponding Material or Product. The amount of Material/Product you sell is dependent on a wide variety of different factors.<br><br>These are the basics of getting your Corporation up and running! Now, you can start purchasing upgrades to improve your bottom line. If you need money, consider looking for seed investors, who will give you money in exchange for stock shares. Otherwise, once you feel you are ready, take your Corporation public! Once your Corporation goes public, you can no longer find investors. Instead, your Corporation will be publicly traded and its stock price will change based on how well it's performing financially. You can then sell your stock shares in order to make money.<br><br><u>Tips/Pointers</u><br>-The 'Smart Supply' upgrade is extremely useful. Consider purchasing it as soon as possible.<br><br>-Purchasing Hardware, Robots, AI Cores, and Real Estate can potentially increase your production. The effects of these depend on what industry you are in.<br><br>-In order to optimize your production, you will need a good balance of Operators, Managers, and Engineers<br><br>-Different employees excel in different jobs. For example, the highly intelligent employees will probably do best if they are assigned to do Engineering work or Research & Development.<br><br>-If your employees have low morale, energy, or happiness, their production will greatly suffer.<br><br>-Tech is important, but don't neglect sales! Having several Businessmen can boost your sales and your bottom line.<br><br>-Don't forget to advertise your company. You won't have any business if nobody knows you.<br><br>-Having company awareness is great, but what's really important is your company's popularity.

For this reason, Synthoids are virtually identical to humans in form, composition, and appearance.<br><br>Synthoids were first designed and manufactured by ${gt.I.OmniTekIncorporated} sometime around the middle of the century. Their original purpose was to be used for manual labor and as emergency responders for disasters. As such, they were initially programmed only for their specific tasks. Each iteration that followed improved upon the intelligence and capabilities of the Synthoids. By the 6th iteration, called MK-VI, the Synthoids were so smart and capable enough of making their own decisions that many argued ${gt.I.OmniTekIncorporated} had created the first sentient AI. These MK-VI Synthoids were produced in mass quantities (estimates up to 50 billion) with the hopes of increasing society's productivity and bolstering the global economy. Stemming from humanity's desire for technological advancement, optimism and excitement about the future had never been higher.<br><br>All of that excitement and optimism quickly turned to fear, panic, and dread in 2070, when a terrorist group called Ascendis Totalis hacked into ${gt.I.OmniTekIncorporated} and uploaded a rogue AI into severeal of their Synthoid manufacturing facilities. This hack went undetected and for months ${gt.I.OmniTekIncorporated} unknowingly churned out legions of Synthoids embedded with this rogue AI. Then, on December 24th, 2070, Omnica activated dormant protocols in the rogue AI, causing all of the infected Synthoids to immediately launch a military campaign to seek and destroy all of humanity.<br><br>What ensued was the deadlist conflict in human history. This crisis, now commonly known as the Synthoid Uprising, resulted in almost ten billion deaths over the course of a year. Despite the nations of the world banding together to combat the threat, the MK-VI Synthoids were simply stronger, faster, more intelligent, and more adaptable than humans, outsmarting them at every turn.<br><br>It wasn't until the sacrifice of an elite international military taskforce, called the ${gt.I.Bladeburners}, that humanity was finally able to defeat the Synthoids. The ${gt.I.Bladeburners}' final act was a suicide bombing mission that destroyed a large portion of the MK-VI Synthoids, including many of its leaders. In the following weeks militaries from around the world were able to round up and shut down the remaining rogue MK-VI Synthoids, ending the Synthoid Uprising.<br><br>In the aftermath of the bloodshed, the Synthoid Accords were drawn up. These Accords banned ${gt.I.OmniTekIncorporated} from manufacturing any Synthoids beyond the MK-III series. They also banned any other corporation from constructing androids with advanced, near-sentient AI. MK-VI Synthoids that did not have the rogue Ascendis Totalis AI were allowed to continue their existence, but they were stripped of all rights and protections as they were not considered humans. They were also banned from doing anything that may pose a global security threat, such as working for any military/defense organization or conducting any bioengineering, computing, or robotics related research.<br><br>Unfortunately, many believe that not all of the rogue MK-VI Synthoids from the Uprising were found and destroyed, and that many of them are blending in as normal humans in society today. In response, many nations have created ${gt.I.Bladeburners} divisions, special military branches that are tasked with investigating and dealing with any Synthoid threats.<br><br>To this day, tensions still exist between the remaining Synthoids and humans as a result of the Uprising.<br><br>Nobody knows what happened to the terrorist group Ascendis Totalis.`,SS[t]=new LS(e,t,n),e="A Green Tomorrow",t=ia.t.AGreenTomorrow,n="Starting a few decades ago, there was a massive global movement towards the generation of renewable energy in an effort to combat global warming and climate change.
